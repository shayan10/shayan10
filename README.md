# Hi there!

I am Shayan Khan, a driven Backend Engineer specializing in Python and Node.js, wiith 2+ years industry experience developing production-ready REST API services. I have worked with several Fintech startups, integrating payment technologies like Stripe and Plaid ACH payments, and implement various authentication schemes such as OAuth, Access/Refresh tokens, and 2FA authenticaiton. I love working on REST APIs, designing and integrating different services, and have been getting into Data Analysis with at [All Things Blockchain Network](https://www.atbn.io/). 

## Highlights 
Here are some of my most notable accomplishments so far:
- ‚≠ê Reduced bottlenecks by 50% for [ATBN](https://atbn.io/) services by refactoring codebase to use asynchronous processing with FastAPI
- ‚≠ê Eliminated 20% of ATBN's API overage costs by caching responses from third-party APIs
- ‚≠ê Designed an in-house Market Sentiment Analysis service powered by OpenAI's DaVinci LLM
- :star: Developed an REST API that handles in-app currency transactions with Stripe Connect and Django at [Pointklub Inc.](https://www.pointklub.com/)
